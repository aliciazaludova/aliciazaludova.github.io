                    <h3>A patchy chronicle of my learnin' at <em>Full Stack Evening Cohort 7</em> at the Nashville Software School, starting February 12, 2018.</h3>

                  <h2>Week One</h2>
              
                  <p><em>We are not in Kansas anymore.</em></p>
              
                  <p>There is so much to learn. We started out soft and slow on days one and two. There were introductory talks by the founder and the teachers. They seem supportive and enthusiastic. I am looking forward to this!</p>

                  <h2>Week Two</h2>
              
                  <p>This week we were introduced to the terminal in tandem with GitHub. I felt like Dorothy tip-toeing through the forest of the fighting trees in the borderlands of Oz. GitHub is an unsightly, un(user)-friendly zone with an obstacle course of switches and pulleys. For comfort I lean in and hug my little dog Toto. I mean, my furry cat Frootie.</p>

                <div class="backdrop"> 
                    <h2>Week Three</h2>
              
                    <p>JavaScript hovers over me like a flying monkey! I don't really want it to fly away; I just want it to become my pet. Everything is "for loops" and creating variables. I am getting used to the idea of a variable changing value as you progress through the code. JS is dynamic, afterall. It is a revelation to think about how a thing you defined at the beginning transforms to be something else at the end. I am not used to thinking about it code way. HTML is sort of like Dorothy's sleepy hometown in Kansas, and Javascript is Oz--the crazy land of the wacky and unexpected.</p>

                    <h2>Week Four</h2>
              
                    <p>Our teams have been meeting for a few weeks now. I have a great team. Not only do we get stuff done but everyone is goofy and we have fun--I will spare you a Wizard of Oz reference this time. But just this once. Everyone has something to contribute with our beginners' patchwork knowledge and we aren't afraid to ask each other for clarification when we need it.</p>
                    <p>I have become aware that not everything is solved with a "for loop". Too bad, since that is a snippet of code I have memorized. Functions and methods do seem more economical. There is one burning concern: Isn't it not-very-nice to call the arrow "fat"?</p>
