          <h1>Hi. I'm Alicia Zaludova.</h1>

          <p>But you can call me Alice. It's appropriate for the wonderland I've entered since beginning to learn web development. A couple things happened that led me to choose this continuous journey of a field.</p>

          <p>A year ago, a friend said to me "You should learn how to code." The way i remember it, the suggestion came out of nowhere, but it must have been based on his familiarity with (i.e. tolerance of) a couple personality traits: an analytic bent applied to even the most trivial matters and curiosity run amok. These are things I cannot help.</p>

          <p>I had been learning to code through a program online, supressing the compulsion to raise my hand and ask a question. Nobody around but my cat to see that! Google Groups help from staff or fellow students never seemed to arrive soon enough or was too cryptic for my beginner level, and I was not yet a champion Googler. So I did a lot of research into various schools, ultimately deciding on the Nashville Software School. It stood out as an obvious choice. It's a non-profit with close ties to the tech community in the city. I could see it had integrity in many ways, including its offering of programs lasting longer than the four-month gauntlet-style bootcamps that were everywhere. I ended up joining Evening Cohort 7 to learn full stack development.</p>
