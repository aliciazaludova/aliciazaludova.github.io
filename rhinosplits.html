            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>Rhino Splits is a peer-to-peer mobile payment app whose trajectory's peak will place it at the top of the market as <em>the Apple of payment apps</em>. The lifestyle of their user is similar to their company culture:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Casual</li>
                  <li>Traveling and dining out frequently</li>
                  <li>Primary age range of 25-30 years</li>
                  <li>Tech savvy</li>
                  <li>Disposable income</li>
                 </ul>
              <p>The company was started by a seasoned user experience professional and a recent graduate of a full stack development program. They are aware that there are plenty of good-enough mobile banking apps out there, but are determined to create the one that is is easiest for users to integrate into their lives.</p>

                <h2>Challenge Statement</h2>
                 <h3>How might we...</h3>
                  <h4 class="dates-of emp"><em>...provide an easy, secure, and fun way for 25-35 year-olds to make peer-to-peer payments on the go?</em></h4>
                  <p>A strong foundation was required for the project. This comes in the form of a "challenge statement" or "problem statement". It’s a “Goldilocks Situation”: If the challenge statement is too narrow, there is no room to explore solutions. Too broad of a statement doesn't provide a clear starting point. It has to be be just right. Brainstorming with other students who were working on the same project yielded this workable statement to guide us.</p>

                  <h2>Research Yields Themes and Insights</h2>
                    <p>The way to find out what users value is to do research. It's important to understand behaviors and frustrations, as a basis for testing hypotheses and finding patterns. Only then can the right solution arrive.</p>
                    <p>I interviewed two potential users and then met with other students working individually on the same project so we could share our results from our respective interviews. Replies from interviewees were written onto post-it notes and put on a white board. We looked for similar themes and grouped them together. This allowed us to distill our results into "themes" and "insights", which told us what users value. Here is what we gained:</p>

                            <p>A user was recruited to sit down and go through the motions of Kelly's journey once I completed the wireframe using Adobe XD. Some obvious elements were missing, such as a back-button as a fixture on every page. The user didn't notice how to cancel a processing payment, as the word "Cancel" was originally small and at the top next to the back button--so a large cancel button was added. But overall, the testing went smoothly as long as there was no deviation from Kelly's prescribed journey. With more complexity I anticipate more opportunities for the tester to be confused, which means more things I will have the opportunity to improve. Fortunately, I think it's fun! Greater functionality, colors, and a more distinctive style (and logo) will also be added before further testing. I will post the next phase after more progress is made.</p>
