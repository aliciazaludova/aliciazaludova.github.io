            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>Rhino Splits is a peer-to-peer mobile payment app whose trajectory will reach the goal of being the Apple of payment apps. The lifestyle of their user is much the same as their company culture:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Casual</li>
                  <li>Travels and eats out frequently</li>
                  <li>Primary age range of 25-30 years</li>
                  <li>Tech savvy</li>
                  <li>Has disposable income</li>
                 </ul>
              <p>The company was started by a seasoned user experience professional and a recent graduate of a full stack development program. They were well aware that there were plenty of good-enough mobile banking apps out there, but were determined to create the one that is was easiest for users to integrate into their lives.</p>

                <p>Here is a visual of the process (ACTS) involved in creating the app.</p>

              <h2>My Role</h2>
               <p>I was responsible for the experience design, overall visual design, user research, and creative direction of the app. I researched competitors, interviewed users, tested the app, and determined the direction for the interaction design. A graphic designer was enlisted to help with the rhino logo. </p>

                <h2>Challenge Statement</h2>
                 <h3>How might we...</h3>
                  <h4 class="dates-of emp"><em>...provide an easy, secure, and fun way for 25-35 year-olds to make peer-to-peer payments on the go?</em></h4>
                  <p>A strong foundation was required for the project. This comes in the form of a "challenge statement" or "problem statement". It’s a “Goldilocks Situation”: If the challenge statement is too narrow, there is no room to explore solutions. Too broad of a statement doesn't provide a clear starting point. It has to be be just right. Brainstorming with other students working on the same project yielded this workable statement for the initial product.</p>

                  <h2>Research Plan</h2>
                    <p>Understanding what people value leads to new opportunities. Researching user and customer behaviors and frustrations is enormously valuable for          testing hypotheses and finding patterns to design the right solution.</p>
                    <p>I interviewed two potential users and then met with other students working individually on the same project so we could share our results from our respective interviews. Noteworthy replies from those interviewed were written onto post-it notes and put on a white board. We looked for similar themes and grouped them together. This allowed us to distill our results into themes and insights, which served as a guide to what users value.</p>
                    <p>Insight: Users want the app to be simple.</p>
